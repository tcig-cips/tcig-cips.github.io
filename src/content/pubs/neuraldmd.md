  Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins. Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy, and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations lets the method capture complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two challenging problems: recovering the evolution of plasma near the Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*, and reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from sparse station observations. In both cases NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for imaging dynamical systems across astronomy, geoscience, and beyond.
